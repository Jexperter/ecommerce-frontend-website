Developed a dynamic front-end website with the following functionalities:

An indicator showing the number of search results or products available.
Sorting the items by: name, price, or rating.
The ability to show only in-stock items in the search results.
Adding or removing items from the shopping basket.
A total cost of products in the shopping basket.
I learned how to implement these functionalities using TypeScript and became familiar with React components and hooks.

To run my website:
1) Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer, this should come with Vite.
2) Download the zip file of this code and extract it to a suitable place on your computer.
3) Navigate to that folder in your terminal, and type npm install
4) Once the installation is completed, type in npm run dev, which should host the website locally for you.
5) Take the localhost address shown in the output and type it in your browser to see the website.
