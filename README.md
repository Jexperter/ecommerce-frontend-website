Developed a dynamic front-end website with the following functionalities:

An indicator showing the number of search results or products available.
Sorting the items by: name, price, or rating.
The ability to show only in-stock items in the search results.
Adding or removing items from the shopping basket.
A total cost of products in the shopping basket.
I learned how to implement these functionalities using TypeScript and became familiar with React components and hooks.
